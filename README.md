AccessAI –  Detecting Anomalous Swipe Behavior in  Physical Access Control Systems

**Methodology-I:**
**Using DBSCAN(Density Based Clustering).**
I developed a Jupyter notebook to detect anomalous swipe behavior in a simulated physical access control system dataset. The dataset, comprising 31,505 records, was generated for 100 users across 8 doors over 30 days, with columns including Timestamp, UserID, DoorID, DoorName, Direction, and Result. Specific anomalies were simulated, such as access to restricted doors (e.g., Server Room, D03), odd-hour swipes (hours 0–4, 22–23), high failed attempts (5% failure rate), and rapid sequential swipes (within 1–30 seconds). I implemented anomaly detection using DBSCAN, Z-score, and IQR methods. DBSCAN was applied on scaled features (IsRestrictedDoor, IsOddHour, IsFailed, Hour, TimeDiff) after PCA reduction to 2 components, with parameters eps=0.5 and min_samples=5, identifying 76 anomalies. Z-score and IQR methods detected 11,126 and 11,617 anomalies, respectively, capturing more of the known anomalies (e.g., 1,541 rapid swipes, 6,261 odd-hour swipes). DBSCAN’s performance was limited, with only 32 overlaps with odd-hour swipes and none with rapid swipes, indicating a need for parameter tuning and feature improvement. The dataset was saved as AccessAI_Simulated_Swipe_Logs.csv for further analysis. This work demonstrates a foundational approach to anomaly detection, with opportunities for enhancing DBSCAN’s effectiveness through better feature engineering and parameter optimization.
